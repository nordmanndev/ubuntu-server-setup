## Introduction

> This is a fork of <https://github.com/jasonheecs/ubuntu-server-setup> with additional customization, including
>
>
> - setup Hostname
> - setup ZSH and ohmyzsh
> - install node js and yarn
> - python, pip, virtualenvwrapper + some python packages
> - simple git customization
> - ruby
> - VIM (Janus Distribution)
> - postgres / postgis
> - nginx
> - uWSGI
> - certbot
> - and so much more ...

This is an opinionated setup script to automate the setup and provisioning of Ubuntu servers, **primarily biased towards python web applications**. It does the following:

- Adds a new user account with sudo access
- Adds a public ssh key for the new user account
- Disables password authentication to the server
- Deny root login to the server
- Setup Uncomplicated Firewall
- Create Swap file based on machine's installed memory
- Setup the timezone for the server (Defaults to "Africa/Lusaka")
- Install Network Time Protocol
- Install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- Setup [Python](https://www.python.org/), [`python3-pip`](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/python3-pip) and `virtualenvwrapper`.
- Setup [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) and install some global packages such as `commitizen`, `mdpdf`, `gulp`, `sass`, etc.
- Setup **ZSH** and [`oh-my-zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh) with the [`powerlevel10k` theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- Setup [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) -- a Vim Distribution designed to provide minimal working environment using the most popular plugins and the most common mappings.
- Setup [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Setup [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) and [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)
- Setup [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)
- Setup [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/)
- Plus a whole lot of other things. Have a look at [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) for more details.

[@jasonheecs](https://github.com/jasonheecs)'s original project provides an excellent starting point for provisioning Ubuntu Servers. This fork builds on top of that foundation to develop a heavily opinionated setup for deploying Python web applications. The idea is to be able to quickly setup a Linux box and deploy a Python web application without much of a hassle.

## Installation

SSH into your server, update package list and upgrade packages:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

Clone this repository (& submodules) into your home directory, and run the setup script:

```bash
cd ~
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup.git \
&& cd ubuntu-server-setup \
&& bash setup.sh
```

## Setup prompts

⌨️ When the setup script is run, you will be prompted to enter the username and password of the new user account, as well as Global Git Name and Email Address.

⌨️ Following that, you will then be prompted to add a public ssh key (which should be from your local machine) for the new account. To generate an ssh key from your local machine:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

⌨️ You will further be prompted to specify a [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for the server. It will be set to 'Africa/Lusaka' if you do not specify a value.

<!-- ⌨️ You will also be asked to provide a `hostname` for your server. -->

⌨️ During configuration of Postgres, you will be asked to specify which role to add and whether they should be a superuser or not.

⌨️ When setting up Postfix and configuring System Updates and Notification Settings, you'll be asked for

- the System Administrator's email address (to **receive** notifications)
- the email address that'll be associated with **send**ing emails. This setup uses [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/), so you need to use a Sendgrid verified email address for this.

> This script assumes that the email address you supply is associated with your sendgrid domain. `myhostname` is therefore extracted from this email address. So, if your "mail_from" email address is josh@example.co.zm, then example.co.zm will be used as `myhostname` in the Postfix setup.

⌨️ You will be asked to confirm that you want to have unattended upgrades.

⌨️ You will also have to specify some **folder names** for

- projects directory (for example, *Projects*)
- backup directory
- temporary files directory (this is different from `/tmp`. It's just a folder in the home directory that I tend to use as a working directory while experimenting with things or testing stuff).

> These folders are created in the home directory

⌨️ Towards the end, you will be asked for your password when the script attempts to change the default shell to ZSH as the newly created user.

## Post setup actions

- [ ] Reboot and login as the new user
- [ ] Test your email configuration. See example below:
- [ ] configure rclone, backup scripts and cron jobs for daily backups
- [ ] setup [certbot-dns-cloudflare](https://certbot-dns-cloudflare.readthedocs.io/) plugin and ensure that your SSL certificates automatically renew. See an example snippet below for obtaining certificate.
- [ ] incorporate [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/) in your cron jobs
- [ ] update `TINYPNG_API_KEY` and `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in `.zshrc`
- [ ] setup your projects and deploy

Here's an example to test that your email works. I use the awesome [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com) and with this configuration you should get a 10/10 score.

```bash
sendmail -f sender@example.com recipient@someplace.com
From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@someplace.com
Subject: This looks like a test
Hi there, this is my message, and I am sending it to you!
.
```

Obtaining an SSL Cetificate using the [certbot-dns-cloudflare](https://certbot-dns-cloudflare.readthedocs.io/) plugin:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials /path/to/your/cloudflare_configuration.ini \
  -d www.example.co.zm \
  -d example.co.zm
```

## Supported versions

The upstream version of this setup script has been tested against Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04. However, this fork primarily targets **Ubuntu 20.04**, and has only been tested on:

- official **AWS** Ubuntu 20.04 AMIs (Amazon EC2 Instances)
- Ubuntu 20.04 droplets on **DigitalOcean**

Feel free to adapt it to other Ubuntu versions and try it on Linode and other providers. Would appreciate any feedback.

### Important Note

By default, the `master` branch is designed for installation on DigitalOcean's droplets. If you would like to run this on AWS without problems, you might wanna make a few modifications based on the `AWS` branch (which I have not updated in a while, since I've been more inclined towards DigitalOcean lately – as of June 2021).

> **The main difference(s) between DigitalOcean setup and AWS setup**:
>
> - **Default user**: on DigitalOcean, the default user is root, while on AWS, the default user is ubuntu. This affects how certain things are installed, for instance, [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
> - **Hostname setup**. on DigitalOcean, you can define the hostname when creating the droplet, and a lot of associated settings come preconfigured. On AWS, this has to be done manually. In this script, the `setupHostname()` function is executed only when installing on AWS. It is totally ignored when installing on a DigitalOcean Droplet (you'll see that it's commented out in the `setup.sh` script).

## Running tests

Tests are run against a set of Vagrant VMs. To run the tests, run the following in the project's directory:  

`./tests/tests.sh`

## TODO

- [X] Setup Postfix
- [X] Setup `virtualenvwrapper`
- [X] automatic updates and system notifications (logs, etc.)
- [X] setup nginx
- [X] setup uWSGI
- [X] Fix broken tests
- [ ] Check the git config, I think it doesn't work because the command needs to be run as the new user
- [ ] setup [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer)
- [ ] minimize / eliminate user input for some operations like _Unattended upgrades_, _Postgres setup_, etc.
- [ ] Further server hardening to quench any lurking paranoia 🕵🏿‍♀️💣🧨
- [ ] Continually improve this README
